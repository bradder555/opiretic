# Start Here
## Why
My reticulation controller sucks, it loses the time and config and takes ages to reconfigure.
Would be a fun little project to build my own...

## The Criteria
### Hardware
- Use mostly cheap stuff I already have around
- Runs on 5v
- Has built in wifi

### Software
- Beautiful functional front end
- A decent HTTP API

#### If using microcontroller
- Arduino

#### If using linux SBC
- Python + FastAPI for the backend
- Svelte + Node for the frontend

## The actual hardware 
I started with an ESP32, however it looks like I was having heap fragmentation issues. 
I didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to fix these issues, so moved onto the OrangePI.
This has the advantage of having Git, SSH, Cron, services, etc
